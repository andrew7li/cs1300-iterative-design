        All of the users successfully completed the four tasks they were tasked
        with. We tasked the users to find information about Ibuprofen and update
        their notes. The subtasks for this scenario included noting where users
        would click on the homepage, finding more information about Ibuprofen,
        and updating notes about Ibuprofen. Generally, users' actions were in
        line with our expectations. We expected users to find information about
        Ibuprofen through clicking the “Anti-inflamatory drug” category on the
        homepage or with the search button and clicking into the Ibuprofen page.
        To update their notes, we expected them to go to the saved drugs page
        through the navigation bar.

        Additionally, as a final sub task, we wanted to gauge users'
        perspectives on different functions of the app. All of the users were
        able to identify the functions that we intended for the app to have
        (including finding drug information, seeing relevant articles, and
        taking notes on drugs).

        Users noted the difficulty in finding the navigation bar, as at times,
        they were only able to access it by scrolling to the bottom of the page.
        As a result, there was some confusion about where the user was on the
        app. When creating this prototype, we didn’t expect this to happen as
        the navigation bar seemed to display properly on the Figma prototype on
        our laptops. So, in future mockups, we would edit the navigation bar to
        fix it relative to the bottom of the user’s screen. Finally, we noticed
        that each user had a different perspective on how simple the app should
        be. Thus, in future mockups, we would also review our current pages to
        ensure that all of them are necessary and contain necessary information.
